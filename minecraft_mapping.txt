The cubic volume occupied by a Minecraft block is a single Cell. The save
game format is all about the management of these cells.

World:  512x512 regions
Region: 32x32 chunks
Chunk:  16x16 cells

The Y dimension is 128 blocks tall.

Each chunk used to be stored as an NBT file.
Recently, MCR files are instead used, and bundles a bunch of NBT files.

MCR file are just containers for NBT files; the MCR format is described in the
link.
